# Discord Interactions
This library is intended to receive Discord Interactions though your own API endpoint. 

**This is a Work-in-progress!!!**
The code is a straight rip out of one of my bots. It might not be very flexible at this stage.

# I want to receive interactions through the gateway instead my own API.
